# The Collatz Sequence Generator

## Description

The Collatz sequence start with any positive integer $n$. The next term is obtained as follows:
- If $n$ is even, the next term is: $\frac{n}{2}$.
- If $n$ is odd, the next term is: $(3 \times n) + 1$.
- If $n$ = 1, the sequence ends.

## How it Works
