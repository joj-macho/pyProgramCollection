# Conway Game of Life

## Description

The Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automata simulatioon inventd in 1970 by John Conway.
The game follows the rules;
1. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives.
2. Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell.
3. All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.

The "game" is actually a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, needing no input from human players.   One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves.

## How it Works
